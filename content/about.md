About me
==============================================

<div>

[FIGURE src="image/bewgorp.jpg?w=200" class="about-image"]

<p class="about-intro">My name is <strong>Rafal Tomal</strong> and Iâ€™m a web designer and developer. I was born and raised in beautiful southeastern Poland and currently reside in the Chicago area.</p>

<p class="about-cont">I moved to the USA right after graduating high school to start a new life and my career as a web designer. I made the decision to quit college and my first full-time job and start my own freelance business when I was 21.</p>

<p class="about-cont">This decision led me into some new opportunities and helped me to meet many great people and enjoy new experiences.</p>

<h4>My perfect client is...</h4>
<p>For me, perfect clients are entrepreneurs, small business owners, blogger and web development agencies who want help with their online presence. I can help them with every aspect of internet marketing. They can utilize me from web development to SEO and ad campaign managements. Anyone struggling online to improve their business can use my services.</p>

<h4>You should hire me because...</h4>
<p>I've developed more than 45 wordpress based websites from scratch without using any theme or template. Developing a website from theme or template is 1 to 2 days of work for me and I can do it really professionally because of the experience. I've helped many small manufacturing businesses to improve their SEO standing and marketing and I'm friendly. :)</p>
</div>

<p class="text">With this website I want to demonstrate my experience with web development and
design as well as my expertise in these fields. When designing websites, my focus is
minimalism, professionalism and friendliness. I'm reliable with a
100% success rate and I hope that if you're looking for someone to help with your website, you'll consider getting in touch with me so we can discuss the details.</p>

<p class="text">Look forward to hearing from you!</p>
