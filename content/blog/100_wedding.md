I designed a wedding invitation!
==================================

I normally don’t do print work – actually, besides my own business cards, I’ve never done any print work at all. But when Pedro, a friend of mine, asked me to help design his wedding invitation, I just couldn’t say no.

The design requirements came with a very ummm… special request. The wedding invitation had to have an illustration or a photo of a particular stuffed camel (a toy one, not a real one) that is very special to the couple and travels everywhere with them. So naturally, it had to be on the wedding invites as well.

Well, it wasn’t an easy task, but I’m quite happy with the way it turned out.

The original.

Congratulations Pedro and Silvia, can’t wait for the big party!
